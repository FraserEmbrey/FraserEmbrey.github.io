I made a [fork] of [nibar] which included yabai support, system stats and date in a clean design.

I wanted to make some changes and add in current weather as well as Music status and the name currently played song. Unfortunately Apple bought DarkSky whose API I was using to source data for the widget. I also made some aesthetic changes to match my tastes. Please check out the repository and any suggestions for new features or good weather APIs I can use would be greatly appreciated ðŸ˜Š.

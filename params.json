It has been made for use on both mobile and desktop and also has a print–out stylesheet. I have used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build it.  You can view the site (which is hosted on GitHub) [here](http://fraserembrey.github.io/Kitchen-Website/ 'Kitchen Website').\r\n\r\n###Personal Website\r\n\r\nI have a very boring and quite badly made personal website that I made as a project a while back, it is on [my own domain](http://www.fraserembrey.co.uk) and links to my CV. It is quite poorly maintained as well but I hope to work on it more over the summer and put some design work and photography up as well as link it with more projects.\r\n\r\n###A Discussion of Causal Relations\r\n\r\nThis is my most recent endeavour, I wish to create a new type of academic work; on that is written and contributed to as open–source code is. The purpose is to study from a scientific and philosophical viewpoint, what exactly we can say about casual relations. Whether they exist in the way we assume or whether causality is merely us attempting to order the world. The project page for this is [here](https://github.com/FraserEmbrey/Reality-of-Causal-Relations).\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with anything, or find a bug etc. Or even if you just want to find out something from me. Please email me at: 00fembrey@brightoncollege.net and I will do my best to sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
